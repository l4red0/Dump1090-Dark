#### Originally from [alkissack](https://github.com/alkissack/Dump1090-OpenLayers3-html/tree/master/public_html/db)
This directory contains static data on some aircraft (registrations, etc)
originally derived from Virtual Radar Server's BasicAircraftLookup.sqb
I have amended this to allow bespoke information to be passed to dump10190.
See the tools directory to understand how I generate it
